      <p>Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where
        summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the
        frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the
        kingdom’s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh
        and unyielding as the<span id="dots">... </span><span id="more"> land they were born to. Sweeping
          from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of
          lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of
          grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce
          wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his
          throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and
          counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and
